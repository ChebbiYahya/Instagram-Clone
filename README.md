# Instagram Clone - Home and Search Pages in Flutter

![banner](./insta_image.png)

## Description

I developed a clone of the Instagram mobile application using Flutter, focusing on the **Home** and **Search** pages. This project highlights:

- **Home Page**: A vertically scrollable feed implemented with `ListView.builder` for smooth rendering.
- **Search Page**: Horizontally scrollable content, also built with `ListView.builder`.
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Added functionality using `RefreshIndicator`.
- **Dynamic Header**: Implemented a `SliverAppBar` that expands and collapses based on user interactions.

This project showcases my ability to recreate modern social media app interfaces with responsive and interactive UI elements.

## Features

- **Responsive UI**: The app adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Efficient Rendering**: Smooth scrolling and efficient loading using `ListView.builder`.
- **Interactive Header**: A flexible `SliverAppBar` for an enhanced user experience.
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Easy content refresh with a pull gesture.
